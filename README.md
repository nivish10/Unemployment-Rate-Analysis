 This report analyses unemployment trends in EU countries, from 2013 to 2023, at the
 combined unemployment rate level, and by gender, age groups (15–24, 25–39, 40–64 years)
 and citizenship status (EU or non-EU). The report also provides insights on job vacancy
 levels across various EU countries over the past decade. The study aims to understand
 long-term trends, gender gaps, age factor and citizenship status to explore their impacts on
 employment and highlight country-specific patterns using descriptive and inferential statistics.
